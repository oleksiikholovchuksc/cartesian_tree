cartesian_tree
==============

Implementation of the Treap in pure C

cartesian_tree is an implementation of quasi-balanced BST called Cartesian Tree or Treap (tree + heap).

 *  Learn more about it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap

 *  One can use it both as SET or MAP data structure, (each node keeps a pointer to user's data).

 *  Supported operations:
    - insert an element in O(log N)
    - lookup for an element with a particular key in O(log N)
    - erase an element with a particular key in O(log N)

 *  Treap is a randomized data structure, so DON'T FORGET TO CALL srand() BEFORE YOU USE IT.
