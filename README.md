==============

Implementation of Treap in pure C.

 *  Learn more about it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap

 *  Can be used both as SET or MAP data structure (each node keeps a pointer to user's data).

 *  Supported operations:
    - insert an element in O(log N)
    - lookup for an element with a particular key in O(log N)
    - erase an element with a particular key in O(log N)
